Hello!
I'm Jingmei, and I have a unique journey that has taken me from China to
the United States over the past 6 years. I started my career as an 
engineer and later became a full-time mom. Currently, I'm passionately
pursuing coding and aspire to transition into a software developer role 
as my new career path.
